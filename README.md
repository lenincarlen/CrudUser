# CrudUser - CRUD’s y métodos HTTP
# I create a component called “UsersList” where you are going to list all the users, showing their first name, last name, email and date of birth. Also, # # place two buttons, one to delete, who will execute a "delete" in the API to delete the selected user. And one to edit, which will put all the information # of the selected user in “UsersForm”.

# See it in action!
